There are some people who can drop a load several times a day. Congratulations to you if you're one of those people. We envy you!</p><p>For us mere mortals, here are some poop-themed gifts that will keep you entertained until your next visit to the toilet.</p>",

We follow randoms on the street like a chicken following its human owner around a farm in the hopes that they release a toxic one in order to get our hit. Once we regain conciousness after passing out from that high, we find another person who looks like they've had a big lunch and do it all over again until it gets dark.</p><p>However, not all of us are lucky enough to have time to follow people and smell their farts. One of our life goals at Skiver.co.uk is to find all the fart-themed gifts that are worth buying so flatulence lovers can enjoy the experience in some form when our bodies fail to produce that intoxicating odour.</p>",
